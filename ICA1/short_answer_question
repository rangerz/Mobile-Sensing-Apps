1. Yes it is more efficient. This program now is more object oriented. 
Since the properties are made private, It prohibits the access from other instances.


2. In case the images are fewer the model is scalable, but in case the images are in large 
quantity the model is not scalable.



3. We can create a memory pool. Pull in the images we need, and throw out the images that are 
not needed.
