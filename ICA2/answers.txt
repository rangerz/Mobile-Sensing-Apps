By calling pause when view disappears and playing again when it appear we assure that
audioManager is only playing when user is on the corresponding view, and memory will
dealloc when needed by ARC. If we would have only one AudioManager for an application
with different views, pausing would make more sense because we will only instanciate it once
and activated when needed
