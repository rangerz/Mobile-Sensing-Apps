1. If we increase the FFT Magnitude Buffer size the program won't work properly because
since we have much more data, we end up with more similar data since we are only graphing 20 points.
To fix it, we need to increase the Equalizer size as well, so we can map more points from the big array.
2. ARC doesn't allow to explicitly call dealloc, so it's better to call pause.
By calling pause when view disappears and playing again when it appear we assure that
audioManager is only playing when user is on the corresponding view, and memory will
dealloc when needed by ARC. If we would have only one AudioManager for an application
with different views, pausing would make more sense because we will only instanciate it once
and activated when needed
